## Introduction
This project is inspired by all the time I spent on
[Bogleheads forum](bogleheads.org). The forum taught me to focus on important
things like asset allocation, location and minimizing costs. The focus is on
simple but [powerful philosophy](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy)
that allows investors to acheive above-average
returns (after costs). This tool is build around the same priciples to help
an average investor manage their investing portfolio.
