(Screenshot of the `lak` command. See the
[section below](#command-line-interface) for more details)

## Background
This project is inspired by
[Bogleheads forum](http://bogleheads.org). Bogleheads focus on a simple but
[powerful philosophy](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy)
that allows investors to achieve above-average
returns after costs. This tool is build around the same principles to help
an _average_ investor manage their investing portfolio.

Lakshmi (meaning "She who leads to one's goal") is one of the principal
goddesses in Hinduism. She is the goddess of wealth, fortune, power, health,
love, beauty, joy and prosperity.

## Introduction
This project consists of a library module (`lakshmi`) and a command-line
tool (`lak`) that exposes some of the functionality of the library. The library
provides useful abstractions and tools to manage your investing portfolio.

[Bogleheads wiki](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Main_Page) is a great
resource for introduction to basic investing concepts like asset-allocation,
asset-location, etc.

The following features are currently available:
- Specify and track asset allocation across accounts.
- Ability to add/edit/delete accounts and assets (funds, stocks, etc.)
inside those accounts.
- Supports manual assets, assets with ticker, Vanguard funds (that don't
have associated ticker symbols),
[EE Bonds](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/products/prod_eebonds_glance.htm)
and
[I Bonds](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/ibonds/res_ibonds.htm).
- Automatic fetching of market value of various types of assets.
- Listing current values of assets, printing detailed information,
printing asset allocation, asset location, etc.
- Tracking of tax-lot information for assets.
- Support for running what-if scenarios to see how it impacts the asset
allocation, etc.
- Analysis of portfolio to identify if there is need to rebalance or
if there are losses that can be
[harvested](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Tax_loss_harvesting).

A new portfolio can be created by either:

-- OR --

2. Using the `lak` commands to create a new portfolio. The following command will
open up an editor to input the desired asset allocation:

```
$ lak init
```

Accounts (His/Her 401(k), Roth IRAs, Taxable, etc.) can be added via
the `lak add account` command:

```
$ lak add account
# Use the above command multiple times to add more accounts.
```

Assets can be added to an account via the `lak add asset` command. Different
kinds of assets can be added to a portfolio. For a complete list, pull up the
help for the command:

```
$ lak add asset --help

TickerAsset represents an asset with a ticker symbol. The value of these assets
is pulled and updated automatically. To add a TickerAsset:

```
lak add asset -p TickerAsset -t account_str
```
where account_str is a sub-string that uniquely matches an account added previously.

That's it. To view all the assets, asset allocation and asset location, run:

```
lak list assets total aa al
```
